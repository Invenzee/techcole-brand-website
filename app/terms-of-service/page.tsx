                                <strong className="text-black block mb-2">(a) Description.</strong>
                                TechCole Service is an online service where individuals or entities that have signed up with TechCole as clients (each, a “Client”) can post specific assignments and project descriptions, including illustrative samples or other media (each, a “Creative Brief”), revise those Creative Briefs (each, a “Revision Brief”) and obtain responses (each, a “Response”) to those Creative or Revision Briefs from design experts retained by TechCole (“Members”). TechCole will provide you, as the Client, the Service according to the Package you have chosen as detailed in section 1(e) below. Your Responses will be created iteratively through a drafting cycle of Creative Briefs, Revision Briefs and Responses, ultimately resulting in a final Response conforming to your various Creative and Revision Briefs.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong className="text-black block mb-2">(b) Creative Brief and Responses.</strong>
                                You are solely responsible for preparing and posting detailed descriptions of each of your Creative Briefs to the Web Site, including providing samples illustrating your Creative Brief and any relevant deadlines. For each Response to a Creative Brief that you want to receive, a term sheet (a “Term Sheet”) will be generated that will contain, and be subject to, the terms and conditions you have established for the Creative or Revision Brief. TechCole is under no obligation to review a Creative or Revision Brief or Term Sheet for any purpose, including accuracy, completeness of information, quality or clarity. TechCole may decide, in its sole discretion, to deny a Creative or Revision Brief or a Term Sheet.

                                <strong className="text-black block mb-2">(c) Reviewing Responses.</strong>
                                When TechCole provides you with a Response, you are responsible for reviewing the Response. If you fail to promptly inform TechCole that the Response is not reasonably responsive to the related Term Sheet or Creative Brief, you will be deemed to have accepted the Response. If you notify TechCole that you think a Response is not reasonably responsive to the related Creative Brief, you shall then submit to the Web Site a Revision Brief containing information regarding amendments or modification to be made to the initial Response. After you provide TechCole with a Revision Brief, TechCole will provide you with a subsequent Response that conforms to the additional criteria you requested. TechCole is not responsible for the content of Responses developed to the extent that such Responses are prepared to conform to your Creative or Revision Briefs.

                                <strong className="text-black block mb-2">(d) Revision Cycles.</strong>
                                Revision cycles generally consist of unlimited additional compositions that incorporate changes you request in a Revision Brief. The purpose of the revision process is to create Responses that move your project forward in the specific direction you have determined. You may request significant changes in the first and second cycles, and the Responses generated might be quite different in nature from the original composition you selected. By the third revision request, your requests shall be modifications of the current composition only. Revision requests that depart from the then-current composition will be honored and completed in a timely manner, however; TechCole reserves the right to charge the client for each such Revision. No revision work, which requires payment, will be started without your authorization.

                            <li>A refund request will need to have a valid reason which must be qualified against the design brief and customer feedback for revisions.

Where a customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job with the intention to claim refund, we do not consider it as a good faith. In such a case we reserve the right to decline a refund request.</li>
                            <li>All design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design therefore it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback in order to get the desired results.</li>
                            <li>100% unique design guarantee entitles you to re-draw if our designed logo is to be found considerably similar to another logo design that may already exist. Any resemblance to an existing design will be merely a coincidence and TechCole will not accept any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client’s responsibility to get their art work copyrighted.</li>
